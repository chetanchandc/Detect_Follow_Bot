# Detect_Follow_Bot
This Micro Project is done using ROS, OpenCV and simulated using Gazebo.

****YET TO MODIFY/DEVELOP MANY****

- Line detection of the obstacles.
- Moves robot 1 meter forward in linear direction, when detects face from input camera.
- Text recognition when detects text from input camera(work on the error pytesseract)
- Follow robot(should work on this)


Run the simulation:

roslaunch my_bot my_bot_gazebo.launch

To view lines of the obstacles

rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
